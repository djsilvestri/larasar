    <h5>How does it work?</h5>
Our music lessons are conducted with <a href="http://zoom.us/" style="color:rgb(77,117,219); text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Zoom</a>, a high-quality video conferencing app that allows for real-time communications over the internet.  You may connect to zoom with a desktop or download their app to your mobile device free of charge.  Your instructor will contact you regarding the best lesson time.  Prior to your lesson, your instructor will send you an e-mail with a link to connect you and join the room.  Our plan is to offer free workshops to our students.
<h5>How much does it cost per lesson?</h5>
  <p>The rates are determined by your instructor.  Generally, the students will have weekly lessons, but we also offer drop-in lessons as well.  Additionally, we can tailor a plan to fit your needs as well as your budget.  As an introductory rate, the pricing is as follows:
     <ul>
              <li>30 minute session - $29</li>
              <li>1 hour session - $49</li>
              <li>Four 30 minute sessions - $99</li>
            </ul>
   <h5>How do I practice what I learned in my lesson?</h5>
   We will be providing a personalized page for each of our students.  On this page, there will be mp3s, videos, and practice exercises. At their request, the lessons may be recorded and then uploaded to the student's personal page.

<h5>Do I need a laptop or desktop for my lessons?</h5>
  <p>The site is viewable on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smart phone.  There will be an app available for both smart phones as well as tablets.  Additionally, we offer the ability to make the site partially work offline.  Once you have established an internet connection, the pages you visit will be saved for viewing when you select airplane mode on your phone or when you temporarily lose an internet connection on a desktop or laptop.  If you encounter any issues with connectivity or browsing, please get in touch with us.  We want to ensure that your experience here is very pleasant.</p>
