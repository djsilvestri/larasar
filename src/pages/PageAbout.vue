      <div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h6 heading-secondary">Rick's Customer Feedback </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div class="feedback">"I was a student of Rick's for a number of years, until I went away to college, and I looked forward to every class. Rick excels at teaching his students what they need to learn in a manner that makes them want to learn it. From helping pick out a new guitar to showing me my favorite songs, Rick was there every step of the way, not only teaching my how to play, but helping to form my idenitity as a musician."</div>
      <cite>&mdash;Julia B.</cite>
      <div class="feedback">"Rick is the best teacher I have ever had. He explains the complexities of music in a way that they make sense, and are exciting to learn. He is a caring, and supportive person and he has changed the way that I see music."</div>
      <cite>&mdash;Rob A.</cite>
      <div class="feedback">"Rick showed me the depth of music, and taught me how to pursue it for myself. He's a friend and mentor."</div>
      <cite>&mdash;Patrick D.</cite>
      <div class="feedback">"Rick Silvestri is the most inspiring teacher I have ever had. He doesn't just play musical instruments, he knows all about music and what lies beneath music. I personally never liked being taught anything, but I look forward to learning new stuff every week from Rick. He has taught me everything that I know about music and has inspired me to move forward in the music industry when I reach college and the years after that. I highly recommend Rick for people looking to learn music from the best."</div>

<div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h4 heading-secondary">What We Offer</div>
    <br />
    <p> We offer music lessons using <a href="http://zoom.us/" style="color:rgb(77,117,219); text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Zoom</a>, a video conferencing app that allows for real-time communications over the internet.  This conferencing solution captures high-quality video and audio, and it allows our instructors to teach an instrument to their students in real time, regardless of the location.  Students can connect to their lesson via desktop, laptop, or mobile device such as an iPad, iPhone, tablet, or an Android phone.  The instructor will establish a secure connection and then e-mail the link to the student.  Both the instructor and the student must have a high-connection (DSL or cable) in order to get the most out of a lesson.  <strong>Please test your internet connection speed <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong>  </p>
    <p>
        After the lesson is completed, the instructor can record a recap of that lesson and send it to the student's personal page on our site.  We also offer the ability to record each lesson for the student's musical development.  Additional features include scrolling tablature, printable PDFs for the student, and access to workshops that will be offered by our very talented group of teachers.
        </p>
 <p>

        <p> We offer both 30 minute lessons as well as one hour lessons.</p>
        <p>As a promotion, we are offering $29 lessons for 30 minutes and $49 lessons for one hour.  Rates will be going up in the future.</p>
Here are the principal benefits of taking online lessons:
     <div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h6 heading-tertiary">Time</div>
          Given people's busy schedules, a primary advantage is the time that is saved driving to and from the studio.  In many instances, the most ideal time for a lesson is around rush hour, so why not save the hassle of sitting in traffic?
    <div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h6 heading-tertiary">Convenience</div>
        Since all that is required is an instrument, a camera-equipped computer, and a positive attitude, a lesson can be given from the comfort of your own home.
<div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h6 heading-tertiary">Accessibility</div>
Take your lesson from anywhere that has high-speed internet, regardless of location or time zone.
<div class="col text-uppercase text-weight-bold text-h6 heading-tertiary">Quality of Instruction</div>
Our instructors are world-renowned and have played with some legendary musicians.  They are passionate about their teaching vocation and have collectively helped countless students improve their skills.  We have a system in place that we believe gets the most out our lessons.
