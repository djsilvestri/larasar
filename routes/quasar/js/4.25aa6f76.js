In addition to the one-on-one focus with world-renowned guitarists, we offer lesson recaps in video format, scrolling tablature, printable PDFs for your personal use away from the computer, and workshops conducted by these musicians to help you hone your skill.  It is our belief that, when learning a new skill like guitar, a student must learn correctly the first time in order to prevent bad habits from forming.  There are intangible elements, such as sitting properly, strumming correctly, and even holding a pick properly, that the instructors will reinforce so that their students can learn good habits and get the most out of their training.
